Plant application frontend; created by Nathaniel Pierson
Created as the capstone project for my fullstack certificate from Actualize coding bootcamp.
Inspired by video games I play with a farming element, such as Stardew Valley and Old School Runescape.
When you make a schedule, it will tell you how long you need to wait before you can next water a plant. When you plant the plant initially, you will also be able to water it to put it in the first growth cycle. Once the plant reaches it's specific growth requirement, it is no longer listed on your list of watering schedules.
